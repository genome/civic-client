                <p>A hackathon and curation jamboree will be held as a pre-meeting of ASHG in collaboration with the ClinGen Somatic working group and hosted by the Scripps Research Institute. The focus of this meeting will be to continue to develop community consensus on data standards for interpretation of variants in cancer, engage software developers for improved functionality, and engage clinical experts for curation of content. Feedback from experts will be used to improve the ClinVar submission system as well as make improvements to the CIViC data model and user interface. Additional related topics will be proposed by meeting participants.</p>

                <p>Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the
                  unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the
                  identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical
                  literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations
                  exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort.
                  Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted
                  for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for
                  Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing
                  an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance
                  of cancer genome alterations. This hackathon and jamboree was held to help establish community standards
                  in this space, introduce and engage users with the existing CIViC resource, engage in variant curation
                  activities, and improve the features, user-friendliness and utility of the CIViC curation
                  interface.</p>
