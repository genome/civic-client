      <p>If you discover a bug or something isn't working quite right, we want to know about it! Please <a href="https://github.com/genome/civic-client/issues">submit an issue to the civic-client github project</a>. We monitor these issues closely and will be able to collaborate on getting the problem resolved quickly.</p>

      <p>If for some reason you do not wish to use github, you may <a href="mailto:genome-civic-help@email.wustl.edu?subject=CIViC Issue Report">send an email to the civic-help email list</a>, to which CIViC developers and researchers are all subscribed.</p>

      <p>We'd prefer to use Github for handling bugs, since the resolution to any issue will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.</p>
