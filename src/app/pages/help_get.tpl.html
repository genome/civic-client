      <h3 class="subtitle">Get Help</h3>
      <p>The best way to get help is by <a href="https://www.biostars.org/t/civic/">posting a question on BioStars</a> and tagging it with 'civic'. Several members of the team monitor BioStars carefully and will respond to your query.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may <a href="mailto:help@civicdb.org?subject=CIViC Help Request">send an email to the civic-help email list</a>, to which CIViC developers and researchers are all subscribed.</p>

      <p>We'd prefer to use BioStars for technical support, since the resolution to any issue will be public for anyone to see and benefit from.</p>
